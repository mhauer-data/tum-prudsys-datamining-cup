This is notebook is used for the creation of easy features. \n","\n","__What is an easy feature?__\n","\n","You can think of it like a column in one of the data files. At the beginning\n","we have the three input files (items, info, orders). In the end we will export 2 files: \n","- ```dynamic_features.pkl```-> All time dependent data such as date features (e.g day_of_month)\n","- ```static_features.pkl```-> All static features such as itemID and so on\n","\n","After this notebook we **only** work with ```dynamic_features.pkl``` and ```static_features.pkl```.\n","\n","_Why the fuck ```*.pkl```?!_ \n","\n","pkl in this case stands for 'pickle' and allows us to very space efficiently safe the data in bytes. When loading the data we don't have the problem with delimiters like we would have with csv. But most important: Later we need to save models and so on with pickle. So we already start here using it to have some consistency in these unconsistent times :D\n","\n","__How do we handle our test set ?__\n","As we already tried out in team 1, it is crucial to think about the complexity of test features beforehand. Therefore, we now prepare the test set from right the beginning. \n","\n","This means that we now already created rows for the testset. This means the aforementioned files then consist out of **all** the data (test + validation + train). _But why?!_ In the first two notebooks we have function (later more about those) to mutate our data. These mutation then directly can be done for test and train set, using the same functions. This finally leads to correct function. Furthermore, everyone who is adding a new feature now already needs to think about, how it may be applied to the train set (in which we have not all information)\n","\n","How the creation of testset features works, will be elaborated later. \n","\n","__What is the structure of this notebook?__\n","\n","1. **Setting up Colab**\n","1. **Notes and Ideas**\n","1. **Setting up Notebook**\n","1. **Create Dynamic_Features Dataframe** \n","1. **Deviation of Promotions and Creation of Test Set**\n","1. **Defining Feature Functions**\n","1. **Applying Features**\n","1. **Testset Mappings**\n","1. **Saving data**\n","\n","__TL;DR__\n","- Input = info.csv/ items.csv / orders.csv\n","- Output = dynamic_features.csv / static_features.csv\n","- Notebook for easy features (new Columns in source data)\n","- Test set is simulated and created already here.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"P94sbukY70Ka","colab_type":"text"},"source":["# 1.
